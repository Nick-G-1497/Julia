The square root of negative one. 

Using j instead of i because \char`\"{}imaginary\char`\"{} is a terrible name for describing the behavior of complex numbers. The history of why we refer to imaginary numbers as follows\+: Renee Decartes ran into the issue of getting a negative number in the radical. Convertionally, this would be regarded as unsolvable with the current doctrine and state of mathematics. He asked the question if you pulled out the square root of negative one as a constant, mechanically as conceptually how would you deal with this. He relized that you can graphically represent numbers of these sort as 2 dimensional. He didn\textquotesingle{}t think anyone would ever use this constant ever again because it made no s ense to him. There is written record that he came up with the most ridulous name he could think of so he named them imaginary numbers. Euler late proposed a slight alternate naming which they are also refer to as complex number since the have 2D properties. Historically j has also been used by electrical engineers because i is already current.
